# Module 3, Lesson 1: Mongoid Setup and Document CRUD

The overall goal of the assignment is to give you practice in:

  * Setting up an application for use with Mongoid
  * Mapping and interacting with Mongoid Document class instances
  * Creating new and updating existing documents in the database

The functional goal of the assignment is to:

  * To configure a Mongoid database connection to build a data tier for Race results.
  * Create, update, find, and delete `Racer` instances.

This is an introductory practice exercise that is intended to give you experience with 
some of the most basic CRUD capabilities within Mongoid. Most of the code is provided to 
you and all of the development is through the interactive `rails console`. There is nothing
to turn in.  

Since the development is through the `rails console`, the tests provided will be evaulating the state of the database after your CRUD interactions.  As a result you must ensure that you are operating on the 'test' database that the rspec tests are running against.  This simply requires the addition of an option when you start up the console:

```shell
$ rails c -e test
```

The console will indicate that the test environment is loaded after you issue the command.

You can find details of the Mongoid API on the 
[`Mongoid Tutorial Page`](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tutorial/ruby-mongoid-tutorial/)

## Functional Requirements

1. Setup the database and get a connection and reference to a document collection.

2. Instantiate a Mongoid object and change its attribute state.

3. Create, find, update and delete documents to/from the database.

## Gettings Started

1. Start your MongoDB server using `mongod`

2. Create a new Rails application called `triracers`.

    ```shell
    $ rails new triracers
    $ cd triracers
    ```

3. Download and extract the starter set of files. The root
directory of this starter set will be referred to as the root directory
of your solution. When extracted correctly -- the `spec` folder and `Gemfile`
should be at the same (root) level.

    ```text
    --- student-start  
        |-- .rspec (important hidden file)
        `-- spec
            |-- test_utils.rb
            |-- lecture1_spec.rb
            |-- lecture2_spec.rb
            |-- lecture3_spec.rb
            |-- rails_helper.rb
            `-- spec_helper.rb
    ```

    * spec - this directory contains tests to verify your solution. You should
    not modify anything in this directory

4. Implement the technical requirements.

5. Run the `rspec` command from the project root directory. The spec files 
are written per-lecture. The steps taken in one lecture can impact the results
of a preceding lecture. However, if you execute all sections correctly, you will be 
able to execute all rspec tests at the end and pass.

    ```shell
    $ rspec

    (N) examples, (N) failures
    ...
    ```

## Technical Requirements

### Lecture 1: Mongoid Connection

In this section we will focus on integrating Mongoid into an 
existing application and gaining access to a client connection
and collections thru Mongoid.

1. Add the `mongoid` gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle`.

    ```ruby
    gem 'mongoid', '~> 5.0.0'
    ```
    
    ```shell
    $ bundle
    ```

    Also add the 'rspec-rails' gem for executing the tests and run `bundle` again

    ```ruby
    gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.0'
    ```

    ```shell
    $ bundle
    ```

2. Generate a `mongoid.yml` configuration file.

    ```shell
    $ rails g mongoid:config
          create  config/mongoid.yml
    ```

3. Inspect the generated defaults in the file and determine
if there are any changes required for your development environment.
The file is well commented and shows other options that are available
but will not be used in class.

    ```yaml
    $ egrep -v '#|^$' config/mongoid.yml 
    development:
      clients:
        default:
          database: triracers_development
          hosts:
            - localhost:27017
          options:
      options:
    test:
      clients:
        default:
          database: triracers_test
          hosts:
            - localhost:27017
          options:
            read:
              mode: :primary
            max_pool_size: 1
    ```

4. Add the `mongoid.yml` file to the `config/application.rb` file so that
tools like `rails console` do not have to manually load the configuration.

    ```ruby
    module Triracers
      class Application < Rails::Application
        ...
        #bootstraps mongoid within applications -- like rails console
        Mongoid.load!('./config/mongoid.yml')
    ```

5. [ Optionally ] set the default `orm` template engine for `rails generate`
commands within the same `config/application.rb` file.  With the `mongoid`
gem installed within your application -- `mongoid` will be the default
`orm` engine. You can use this technique to set the default engine back to
`active_record` or specify the `orm` engine to use on the command line
with the `--orm (name)` option.

    ```ruby
    #which default ORM are we using with scaffold
    #add  --orm none, mongoid, or active_record 
    #    to rails generate cmd line to be specific
    #config.generators {|g| g.orm :active_record}
    #config.generators {|g| g.orm :mongoid}
    ```

6. Generate a skeletal Mongoid `Racer` model class using the 
`rails generate model` command. No properties are required at this time.

    ```shell
    $ rails g model Racer
    ```

7. Use the `rails console` to verify you can obtain a connection to
the database and access the collection associated with `Racer`.

    ```shell
    $ rails c -e test
    
    > Racer.mongo_client
     => #<Mongo::Client:0x43995560 cluster=localhost:27017> 
    > Racer.collection
     => #<Mongo::Collection:0x43955740 namespace=triracers_test.racers> 
    > Racer.collection.name
     => "racers" 
    > Racer.count
     => 0 
    ```

```
$ rspec spec/lecture1_spec.rb
```

### Lecture 2: Model Class/Document

This section focuses on mapping a Rails model class to a MongoDB collecion.

1. Re-generate the Mongoid `Racer` model class using the `rails generate model`
command. 

	* **Hint 1**: `rails d model (ModelName)` will remove an existing model class and fixtures.
	* **Hint 2**: `rails g model (ModelName)` will prompt you before overwriting an existing file.
	* **Hint 3**: adding the `--force` option will overwrite existing files without prompts.

	This class must:
	
	* be named `Racer`
	* include the `Mongoid::Document` mixin
	* have a `first_name` attribute defined to hold a value of type String
	* have a `last_name` attribute defined to hold a value of type String
	* have a `date_of_birth` attribute defined to hold a value of type Date
	* have a `gender` attribute defined to hold a value of type String

    ```
    $ rails g model Racer ...
    ```

2. Map the class properties to documentation properties found within 
our documents. This is not always necessary or desired, but being able 
to form a class that is consistent with Rails naming conventions and then 
custom mapped to the names of the collection and document fields isolates 
the possible differences from the rest of the application. Your model class
mappings must:

    * map the model class to be stored in the `racer1` collection
    * alias the model class `first_name` attribute to the `fn` document property
    * alias the model class `last_name` attribute to the `ln` document property
    * alias the model class `date_of_birth` attribute to the `dob` document property
    * keep the model class `gender` attribute mapped to the `gender` document property

    You can create an empty instance at this point to print a debug message
    that shows the field to document mapping. 
    
    **Hint**: use the `reload!` command 
    to see the new implementation of your model class within `rails console`.

    ```ruby
    > reload!
    > Racer.new
     => #<Racer _id: 5674dafce301d01ff2000001, 
         fn(first_name): nil, ln(last_name): nil, dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil>
    ```

3. Add support for timestamps to the model class. Your model class must:

    * include the `Mongoid::Timestamps` mixin

    At this point you can create an empty `Racer` instance to print a debug message.
    This will show the *field-to-document* mapping to include the 
    timestamp information (e.g., `created_at` and `updated_at`). 
    The timestamps are currently `nil` since the instance has not been saved to the database.

    ```ruby
    > Racer.new
     => #<Racer _id: 5674dbf6e301d01ff2000002, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, 
         fn(first_name): nil, ln(last_name): nil, dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil>
    ```

4. Using the `rails console`, create an instance of your `Racer` class using a 
bulk assignment with a mixture of class and document mappings. **Do not
save it to the database yet**.

    ```ruby
    > r=Racer.new(:fn=>"cat", :ln=>"hat")
     => #<Racer _id: 5674dd1ee301d01ff2000004, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, 
         fn(first_name): "cat", ln(last_name): "hat", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    ```

    Notice that the document was populated with the document field names and the class
    instance reports both the document and mapped ( `class_field_names` ) for each property.

    ```ruby
    > r.attributes
     => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('5674dd1ee301d01ff2000004'), "fn"=>"cat", "ln"=>"hat"}

    > r
     => #<Racer _id: 5674dd1ee301d01ff2000004, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, 
         fn(first_name): "cat", ln(last_name): "hat", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    ```

5. Use the various getters to obtain the state of your instance.

    ```ruby
    > r.first_name
     => "cat" 
    > r.fn
     => "cat" 
    > r[:fn]
     => "cat" 
    > r.read_attribute(:fn)
     => "cat" 
    ```

6. Use the various setters to change the state of your instance.

    Change the `first_name` of the instance using the model class setter method.
 
    ```ruby
    > r.first_name="thing"
     => "thing" 
    ```

    Change the `last_name` of the instance using the `hash[:key]` assignment method.
    
    ```ruby
    > r[:last_name]="one"
     => "one" 
    ```

    Set the `dob` document field using the `write_attribute` reflection method.

    ```ruby
    > r.write_attribute(:dob, Date.new(1957,3,12))
     => 1957-03-12 00:00:00 UTC 
    ```

7. From the list of methods for the object, inspect the state of your instance 
by locating a method we believe is called `changed`. Use the
`methods` command to get a (huge) list of all methods that can be called. Then,
use the array `grep` command to reduce that list to methods that are related to our
`changed` search criteria.

    ```ruby
    > r.methods.grep /changed/
     => [:changed_for_autosave?, ... :changed?, :children_changed?, :changed_attributes] 
    ```

    Call the `changed?` command to determine if the object needs to be saved.

    ```ruby
    > r.changed?
     => true 
    ```

    Verify the state was is not yet written to the database by using the collection.

    ```ruby
    > Racer.collection.find(:_id=>r.id).first
     => nil 
    ```

8. Save your instance to the database using the `save` method.

    ```ruby
    > r.save
     => true 
    ```

    Verify the object reports that it has been saved.

    ```ruby
    > r.persisted?
     => true 
    > r.changed?
     => false 
    ```
    Verify the state is in the database.

    ```ruby
    > Racer.collection.find(:_id=>r.id).first
     => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('5674dd1ee301d01ff2000004'), 
      "fn"=>"thing", "ln"=>"one", "dob"=>1957-03-12 00:00:00 UTC, 
      "updated_at"=>2015-12-19 04:37:31 UTC, "created_at"=>2015-12-19 04:37:31 UTC} 
    ```

9. Now that your object is persisted, modify and save its state such that 
it has the following properties:

    * `first_name` => "Sally"
    * `last_name` => nil
    * `gender` => "F"
    * `date_of_birth` => 1957-01-01

    You can inspect your updated object instance and database state using the 
    Rails console.

    ```ruby
    > r
     => #<Racer _id: 5674dd1ee301d01ff2000004, 
       created_at: 2015-12-19 04:37:31 UTC, updated_at: 2015-12-19 04:40:30 UTC, 
       fn(first_name): "Sally", ln(last_name): nil, 
       dob(date_of_birth): 1957-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, gender: "F"> 

    > r.attributes
     => {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('5674dd1ee301d01ff2000004'), 
        "fn"=>"Sally", "ln"=>nil, "dob"=>1957-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, 
        "updated_at"=>2015-12-19 04:40:30 UTC, "created_at"=>2015-12-19 04:37:31 UTC, 
        "gender"=>"F"} 
    ```

```shell
$ rspec spec/lecture2_spec.rb
```

### Lecture 3: Basic CRUD

In the previous section you instantiated and interacted with a transient 
instance. This section concentrates on creating and deleting document
objects.

1. Create a new instance of a `Racer` within the database without going 
through `new`/`save`. Use the `create` method to insert a document with 
the following `Entrant` information, while also manually assigning the `_id`
of the object.

    * `_id` => 1
    * `fn`  => "cat"
    * `ln`  => "inhat"

    Your output from the shell evaluation should be as follows:

    ```ruby
     => #<Racer _id: 1, 
       created_at: 2015-12-19 16:06:27 UTC, updated_at: 2015-12-19 16:06:27 UTC, 
       fn(first_name): "cat", ln(last_name): "inhat", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > Racer.collection.find(:_id=>1).first
     => {"_id"=>1, "fn"=>"cat", "ln"=>"inhat", 
       "updated_at"=>2015-12-19 16:06:27 UTC, "created_at"=>2015-12-19 16:06:27 UTC} 
    ```

2. Accidentally (on purpose) attempt to create the same object a second time.

	**Hint**: use up arrow for command recall

    Your output from the shell command will include the following:

    ```ruby
    Mongo::Error::OperationFailure: E11000 duplicate key error index: ....$_id_ 
        dup key: { : 1 } (11000)
    ```

3. Create a transient instance of the object this time (with `new` instead of `create`)
with the same `_id` but different field properties. Use the `upsert` method to 
update any existing object with the assigned `_id`, if found, or create a new instance.
Either way, we will end up with a document in the database with the provided 
identifiying information.

    ```ruby
    > r=Racer.new(:_id=>1, :fn=>"thing", :ln=>"one")
    > r.upsert
    > r
     => #<Racer _id: 1, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, 
       fn(first_name): "thing", ln(last_name): "one", 
       dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > Racer.collection.find(:_id=>1).first
     => {"_id"=>1, "fn"=>"thing", "ln"=>"one"} 
    ```

    One annoying thing to notice is that the original `created_at` was lost and the
    `updated_at` was set to nil instead of the upsert time. You can compensate for 
    the loss of `update_at` using the `touch` command.

    ```ruby
    > r.touch
    > r
     => #<Racer _id: 1, created_at: nil, updated_at: 2015-12-19 16:16:50 UTC, 
       fn(first_name): "thing", ln(last_name): "one", 
       dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > Racer.collection.find(:_id=>1).first
     => {"_id"=>1, "fn"=>"thing", "ln"=>"one", "updated_at"=>2015-12-19 16:16:50 UTC} 
    ```

    You can automate the generation of the `update_at` by adding the following
    callback to the `Racer` model class.

    ```ruby
    class Racer
      ...
      include Mongoid::Timestamps
      ...

      before_upsert do |doc|
        doc.set_updated_at
      end
    end
    ```

    The following is a complete sequence with the callback included. We still lose the 
    `created_at` during the upsert but the `updated_at` is auotmatically inserted prior
    to the upsert call being made to the database.

    ```ruby
    > reload!
    > Racer.find(1).delete
    > Racer.create(:_id=>1, :fn=>"cat", :ln=>"inhat")
     => #<Racer _id: 1, 
       created_at: 2015-12-19 17:47:00 UTC, updated_at: 2015-12-19 17:47:00 UTC, 
       fn(first_name): "cat", ln(last_name): "inhat", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > r=Racer.new(:_id=>1, :fn=>"thing", :ln=>"one")
     => #<Racer _id: 1, 
       created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, 
       fn(first_name): "thing", ln(last_name): "one", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > r.upsert
     => true 
    > r
     => #<Racer _id: 1, 
       created_at: nil, updated_at: 2015-12-19 17:48:00 UTC, 
       fn(first_name): "thing", ln(last_name): "one", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > Racer.collection.find(:_id=>1).first
     => {"_id"=>1, "fn"=>"thing", "ln"=>"one", "updated_at"=>2015-12-19 17:48:00 UTC} 
    ```

4. Create a second instance with a unique `_id` and properties. This time 
you should get a new instance created.

    * `_id` => 2
    * `fn`  => "thing"
    * `ln`  => "two"

    ```
    > two=Racer.new ...
     => #<Racer _id: 2, 
       created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, 
       fn(first_name): "thing", ln(last_name): "two", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > two.upsert
     => true 
    > two
     => #<Racer _id: 2, 
       created_at: nil, updated_at: 2015-12-19 17:54:06 UTC, 
       fn(first_name): "thing", ln(last_name): "two", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > Racer.collection.find(:_id=>2).first
     => {"_id"=>2, "fn"=>"thing", "ln"=>"two", "updated_at"=>2015-12-19 17:54:06 UTC}
    ```

    Note that because the upsert is implemented in the database, the client cannot 
    reliably supply a conditional `created_at` with upsert.

5. Get a reference to `Racer.id=1` and issue a destroy (or delete to bypass callbacks) 
on that specific Racer.

    ```ruby
    > Racer.where(:id=>1).first
     => #<Racer _id: 1, 
       created_at: nil, updated_at: 2015-12-19 17:48:00 UTC, 
       fn(first_name): "thing", ln(last_name): "one", dob(date_of_birth): nil, gender: nil> 
    > Racer.where(:id=>1).delete
     => 1 
    > Racer.where(:id=>1).first
     => nil 
    ```
    
6. Create a `Racer` also with the name "Sally" in the database. This first name
should match the `Racer` created in the lecture 2 section.

    After you have created your new Racer, you should have two racers with the `first_name`
    of "Sally" if you have the `Racer` from the previous section. If not -- you will have 
    just a single `Racer`.

    ```ruby
    > Racer.where(:first_name=>"Sally").map {
      |r| "#{r.id} #{r.fn}, #{r.ln}, dob=#{r.dob}, created_at=#{r.created_at}"}
     => ["5674dd1ee301d01ff2000004 Sally, , dob=1957-01-01, created_at=2015-12-19 04:37:31 UTC", 
         "5675a659e301d01ff2000005 Sally, , dob=, created_at=2015-12-19 18:47:53 UTC"]
    ```

7. Delete all `Racers` not having the `first_name` of `Sally` using
the `where()` and `destroy_all()` methods. We have not specifically
covered the `where()` function and syntax yet and where it differs
from `collection.find()`, but it plays an important role with
`delete/destroy_all()`.  Append ".ne" to the property name when testing
for inequality.  With the `Racer` from the previous section -- you should
complete this assignment with two `Racer`s remaining and they both should
have the `first_name` of Sally.

    After you destroy all racers not having the `first_name` as `Sally`, you 
    should end up with `0` matching the following query.

    ```ruby
    > Racer.where(:first_name.ne=>"Sally").count
     => 0
    ```

```shell
$ rspec spec/lecture3_spec.rb
```
